            <p id="about">I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in 3D modeling and design, and I am excited to start
                my career as a 3D modeler for video games. During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in 3D modeling
                software such as Maya, ZBrush, and 3ds Max, and I have experience working on projects in both individual and
                team settings. I am passionate about video games and fascinated by the process of bringing game worlds to life
                through 3D modeling and design. <br> <br>
                Aside from 3D modeling, I also have experience in graphic design, and I am proficient in Adobe Photoshop,
                Illustrator, and InDesign. My background in graphic design has given me an eye for detail and composition, which
                I apply to my 3D modeling work to ensure that the models are both visually appealing and functional for their
                intended use in the game. <br> <br>
                In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and drawing. These hobbies have helped me develop
                my creativity and attention to detail, which I bring to my 3D modeling work. I am a quick learner and eager to
                continue developing my skills in 3D modeling and design, and I am excited to contribute my passion and
                enthusiasm to a team that is committed to creating amazing video game experiences."
