        <!--         <p id="about">I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in 3D modeling and design, and I am excited to
            start
            my career as a 3D modeler for video games. During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in 3D
            modeling
            software such as Maya, ZBrush, and 3ds Max, and I have experience working on projects in both individual
            and
            team settings. I am passionate about video games and fascinated by the process of bringing game worlds
            to life
            through 3D modeling and design.

            <p class="detailed_desc">I did what I had to do. Hank Schrader was getting too close. He was getting too
                close to the truth about who I really was. He knew about my secret life as Heisenberg, the infamous drug
                lord of the Southwest. And I couldn't let him interfere with my business any longer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="detailed_entry" id="skills">
            <p class="detailed_desc">I did it. I built an empire. A drug empire, sure, but an empire nonetheless. And
                look where it's gotten me.

                I used to be a good man. A teacher. But now, I don't know. I'm not sure if I even recognize myself
                anymore. I've done terrible things. I've hurt people. I've destroyed lives. And for what? Money? Power?
                Is that all that matters?

                But then again, maybe none of that matters. Maybe success is its own reward. Maybe the ends justify the
                means.

                I don't know. All I know is that I'm here now, at the top of the game. And I'll do whatever it takes to
                stay there. Even if it means sacrificing everything I once held dear.

                Sometimes, in the quiet moments, I wonder if it was all worth it. If the price of my success was too
                high. If I've lost myself in the pursuit of power.

                But then I remember why I did it. I remember my family. And I know that I did what I had to do to
                protect them.

                I may not be a good man anymore. But I'll always be a family man. And that's what truly matters.

            <p class="detailed_desc">"I don't get it. What's the appeal of vaping? It seems like everyone is doing it
                these days, but I don't see the point."
                Walter takes a puff from the vape and exhales a cloud of vapor.
                "I mean, sure, it's supposed to be healthier than smoking. But is it really? We don't know the long-term
                effects of vaping yet. And it still contains nicotine, which is highly addictive."
                Walter takes another puff and shakes his head.
                "And what's with all these different flavors? Blueberry, cherry, cotton candy? It's like they're trying
                to make it appealing to kids."
                Walter sets down the vape and leans back on the couch.
                "I guess I just don't understand why people feel the need to inhale anything into their lungs in the
                first place. It's not natural. We're not meant to do that."
                Walter looks out the window, lost in thought.
                "But then again, maybe I'm just old-fashioned. Maybe I'm missing out on something. Maybe vaping is the
                future, and I'm just stuck in the past."
                Walter picks up the vape again and takes another puff.
                "But for now, I think I'll stick to good old-fashioned air. It may not be as exciting, but at least I
                know what I'm breathing in."
                Walter sets down the vape and stands up, walking towards the kitchen.
                "Besides, I've got bigger things to worry about than vaping. Like staying alive in this crazy world I've
                gotten myself into."
                Walter disappears into the kitchen, leaving the vape behind on the coffee table.</p>
