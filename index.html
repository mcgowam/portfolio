        <!--         <p id="about">I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in 3D modeling and design, and I am excited to
            start
            my career as a 3D modeler for video games. During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in 3D
            modeling
            software such as Maya, ZBrush, and 3ds Max, and I have experience working on projects in both individual
            and
            team settings. I am passionate about video games and fascinated by the process of bringing game worlds
            to life
            through 3D modeling and design.

            <p class="detailed_desc">This is a recreation of a weapon from the video game Deep Rock Galactic. It was
                done in a low poly art style and there were many things that I had to learn throughout the construction
                of the model there were a couple things I learned from this project like getting a symmetrical ring of
                angled cylinders in the center chamber of the weapon, and making wires that had the same diameter
                throughout. In total this project took me just under a week to create.</p>

                Making realistic looking textures and wear around the edges was the most difficult part of this project.
                Figuring out how to have good looking and symmetrical rings to hold the chainmail was also difficult.
                This project took me 5 days from start to finish.</p>
